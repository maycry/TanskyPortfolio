      <h2>Onboarding Redesign</h2>
      <p>I had a chance to work on a full revamp of <b>Grammarly onboarding flow</b>. The project included redesigning the home page, Grammarly extension installation, sign up, and adding personalization steps to tailor suggestions to user's writing style.</p>
      <p>One of the main goals of the project was optimizing signup and retention rates. The team gained a lot of knowledge from previous experiments and was eager to apply new findings to design a brand-new onboarding flow.</p>

      <p>We started from <b>Grammaly.com</b>. This landing page was a point where onboarding starts for most of the users. We decide to make page ultra minimalistic to focus users' attention on engaging animation that demonstrates the most appealing features of the product.</p>
      <p>We conducted two user testings that confirmed our hypothesis about demo videos. Users liked them a lot. It took very little time to understand what the product was about. We also trimmed the page drastically by removing all unnecessary information that users pointed out as confusing.</p>
      <p>Another hypotheses for the redesign was the idea of personalization. We let users adjust their experience by answering a couple of simple questions.</p>

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>We worried that additional steps with personalization would damage activation rates but the A/B test showed that most of the users completed the survey and it resulted in increased retention and signup rates.</p>

      <h2>Other Grammarly Marketing Web Pages</h2>
      <p>Over the course of years, I designed many other web pages for Grammarly and developed a design system to keep them consistent and save designers and developers time.</p>
