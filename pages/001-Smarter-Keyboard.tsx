            Grammarly <b>solves the problem</b> of anxiety people have when they
            need to write something important on their phone. Grammarly helps to
            avoid confusion by making writing clear and mistake-free.

            The Keyboard corrects mistakes and suggests improvements while you
            type. You can apply those suggetsion with one click without losing
            the context. This type of interaction works best for messages and
            quick emails and called <b>Inline Mode</b>.

            For more indepth and longer pieces we designed <b>Revise mode</b>.
            It allows to focus on writing suggestion after you finished writing.

            <b>Tone Detection</b> and <b>Synonyms</b> good examples of features
            that are base on machine learning technologies that allows to show
            more complex in-depth suggestions. To differentiate those features I
            came up with a concept of “swoosh”.{' '}

            To bring another level of engagement and improve users writing
            skills passively and encourage people to use Grammarly more in
            general we designed <b>gamification</b> flows.

            <b>Onboarding</b> was the crucial part of the product. Installing
            keyboard is not a trivial task and for many users it was their first
            time doing this. If on-boarding is confusing people would just churn
            without getting any value from our product.
